    min_dim: if provided, resizes the image such that it's smaller

    max_dim: if provided, ensures that the image longest side doesn't
        exceed this value.
    min_scale: if provided, ensure that the image is scaled up by at least
        this percent even if min_dim doesn't require it.
    mode: Resizing mode.
        none: No resizing. Return the image unchanged.
        square: Resize and pad with zeros to get a square image
            of size [max_dim, max_dim].
        pad64: Pads width and height with zeros to make them multiples of 64.

               before padding. max_dim is ignored in this mode.

        crop: Picks random crops from the image. First, scales the image based

        be inserted in the returned image. If so, this window is the
        coordinates of the image part of the full image (excluding
        the padding). The x2, y2 pixels are not included.
